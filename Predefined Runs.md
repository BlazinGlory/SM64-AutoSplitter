# Presets
These are the preset runs defined in the AutoSplitter for each category.

If you want to use custom splits that don't align with these, simply use the settings called "Split on Star # at fadeout" under the "Star Count Based" options and disable the "Category Presets" option.

# Example for 16 Star no LBLJ:

Preset: Splits at 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15, and 16 stars (BOB(1), WF(6), CCM(8), SSL(11), LLL(12), HMC(15), DDD(16))

Say you dont want to split after BOB or SSL (1 or 11). Under "Split on Star # at fadeout" check 6, 8, 12, 15, and 16, then disable the "Category Presets" setting.
