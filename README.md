# SM64-AutoSplitter

This Autosplitter was made to hopefully be an improvement to the one developed by [SporyTike](https://github.com/SporyTike). Many improvements added, including having predefined star counts for runs using the most common splits for each category as well as extra miscellaneous splitting options.

Feel free to ask for more options for custom splits although no gurantee I will be able to implement them.

# Features
Presets for 0, 1, 16, 70, and 120 star.   (You still need to enable desired miscellaneous splits & game version)


## Splitting based on star counts
* On user defined star counts after successfully exiting a stage. (Not BitDW/BitFS or Secret Star Stages)
* For every star (on star grab)
* For every 10th star (also on star grab instead of fadeout)

## Miscellaneous Split Options
* Completing BitDW/BitFS (fadeout after star grab)
* Entering Castle
* Entering BitDW
* Entering DDD
* Entering BitS
* Toad/Mips Stars
* Secret Stars - Toad/Mips
* Switch Activation

Typically 120 Exclusive:
* Vanish Cap Exit
* Cloud Secret Star Exit (Wing Mario Over the Rainbow)

## Versions
* Works for different versions of the game. (Japanese, Shindou, USA, and Europe)
